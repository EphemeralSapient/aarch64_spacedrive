# Compile Space drive on Raspberry Pi

There was no `.deb` release for arm64 on official page so I had to compile it on my raspberry pi 

1. Using ubuntu 24.04 LTS
2. Arch is aarch64
3. Requires almost 18 GB ram, so used Swap of 16 GB [ was using external HDD, took 4 hours ]

Not sure why I made this repo
